- [AWQP Website](https://waterquality.colostate.edu/)

### Projects
- **[awqp-mountain-meadow-spectral-analysis](https://github.com/CSU-Agricultural-Water-Quality-Program/awqp-mountain-meadow-spectral-analysis)**
  - This project focuses on the development of nitrogen fertilizer management zones using drone-derived spectral data 
in mountain meadow hay fields found in Colorado, USA.
